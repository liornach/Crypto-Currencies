# Virtual Coin Value Tracker

This project is a web application that uses jQuery to fetch the values of various virtual coins from an external API, and displays real-time graphs of their values using the Canvas package. It also uses Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.

## Usage

The application allows you to select from a range of virtual coins, and displays their current and historical values in real-time. You can also customize the graph by adjusting the time period and other settings.
